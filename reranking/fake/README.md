# Reranking With Fake Results

### Workflow
1. Ensure that scraping_results.txt reflects the queries you scraped.
2. Prepare fake_results.txt with the following format:
"
Query 1
Fake 1
TITLE=Treating covid-19...
URL=https://www.economist...
DESC=May 9, 2020 - WHEN COVID-19...
Fake 2
TITLE=Research Report...
URL=https://www.businesswire...
DESC=2 hours ago - The neuropathy...
Query 2
...
Query 11
Fake 1
TITLE= Coronavirus won't end...
URL= www.usatoday.com/story...
DESC= May 1, 2020 - If COVID-19...
Query 12
"
Note that the first 10 queries have two fake results, and the last 10 queries have 1 fake result. It's IMPORTANT that you follow this format. Otherwise recorded data may be inaccurate.
3. Run "python3 stitch.py".
4. You'll find txtdata and .pickle files in generated_data
